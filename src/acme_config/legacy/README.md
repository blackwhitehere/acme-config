# Legacy Module

This directory contains the AWS Parameter Store CLI (`ac` command) from acme-config v0.0.x.

This functionality has been removed from acme-config v0.1.0, which now focuses on
local app configuration (schema declaration, env/CLI resolution, feature flags).

The AWS Parameter Store integration will be re-introduced in `acme-env` or
`acme-runtime` as part of environment management.
